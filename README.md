Linear Algebra
--------------
### Static Vector
A vector with static fixed size and capacity that is stored on the stack. Used for small vectors of fixed size.

### Hybrid Vector
A vector with dynamic size and fixed capacity that is stored on the stack. Used for small vectors of variing size.

### Dynamic Vector
A vector with dynamic size and capacity that is allocated on the heap. Used for large vectors.

Error Management
----------------
By default assertions are on, that check for example if an element access is within the allocated storage size (Aka.: Out of bounds access, buffer bverflow). 
This, however, has an impact on performance. To increase performance those assertions can be disables by compiling with the definition: `DISABLE_TWMATH_ASSERTIONS`.

```CMake
target_compile_definitions(${PROJECT_NAME} PUBLIC
	DISABLE_TWMATH_ASSERTIONS
	...
)
```

Customise the behaviour of the error management can be customised with the following definitions. Select only one!
* `TWMATH_THROWÂ´ **default** throws an exception of type runtime error with a message descibeing the failed assertion.
* `TWMATH_EXIT` calls exit(-1) to exit the program (customiseable error output stream)
* `TWMATH_TRAP` traps the execution in a while loop (customiseable error output stream)
* `TWMATH_CUSTOM_ERROR_HANDLER` calls the user defined function: 'void twmath_custom_error_handler(const char* error_message)'

```CMake
target_compile_definitions(${PROJECT_NAME} PUBLIC
	TWMATH_THROW|TWMATH_EXIT|TWMATH_TRAP|TWMATH_CUSTOM_ERROR_HANDLER
	...
)
```

Furthermore you can define the error output stream that should be used when `TWMATH_EXIT` or `TWMATH_TRAP` is selected. The default is: `TWMATH_CERR std::cout`.
```CMake
target_compile_definitions(${PROJECT_NAME} PUBLIC
	TWMATH_CERR my::cerr
	...
)
```
